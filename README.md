# Video Platform
PROJECT: A media platform enphasizing quality and artistry.
Original issue: 
Video quality is sacrificied on popular video sharing sites like youtube, to make them convinient. I set out to make a platform that allows consumers to enjoy media (video/audio/images) at it's full quality as apposed to streaming, which (to be efficient) requires compression. 
The idea came to me when watching one of my favorite music videos, which the director offers a download to the original file. the streamed film vs the full quality file are completely different expereince due to modern streaming requirements on sites like youtube/vimeo


Features: 
 Allow users to create accounts and upload either videos, audio, or imagery. This media can then be downloaded onto the viewer's device via a proprietary format, (to prevent easy piracy) like how Spotify allows one to download music for offline playing 
         
 TODO:

    upload video or upload audio file and choose an image as cover
    
    make the password storing algorithm more secure (currently only hashes the oringinal password using hashlib sha256)
